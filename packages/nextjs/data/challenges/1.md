# #1: The Greeting

Welcome Player. This is the first challenge for the BuidlGuidl CTF game.

Interact with the Challenge #1 contract and register yourself as a player.

Upon completion of a challenge, you will capture (mint) a NFT flag and earn points. Each flag must be minted to the registered Ethereum address for the points to be counted properly.

Try to complete as many challenges as possible and get all the flags back from the Solidity Invaders!

## Player Progress

Check your progress by connecting your Ethereum Wallet with the address you are using to play the game and click on "My Flags" at the top of the page.

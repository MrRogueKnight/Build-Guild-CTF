## 🧩 Challenge #2: Just Call Me Maybe (BuidlGuidl CTF)

### Goal:
Call a restricted function on the Challenge #2 contract **in a way that bypasses the normal caller restriction**.

The contract likely **blocks direct calls** from EOAs (your wallet) and expects the function to be called **via another contract** (a smart contract proxy or intermediary).

---

### 🔍 Hints Breakdown:
- 🛑 "Not all calls are allowed" → Your wallet alone can’t make the call.
- 🧱 "A new contract may be required" → You must **write and deploy a custom contract** that calls the challenge contract.
- 🛠 Scaffold-ETH 2 is recommended for this — but Foundry or Hardhat will also work.

## 🛠️ Summary of What You Need to Do:

1. **Write a smart contract** that:
    - Has a function (e.g. `solveChallenge()`)
    - Inside that function, it calls the restricted function on the Challenge #2 contract (e.g. `challengeContract.callMeMaybe()` or similar)

2. **Deploy your contract** to Optimism.

3. **Call your own contract’s function** (which in turn calls the CTF contract).

4. **Check "My Flags"** — it should show **2/12** if successful.
